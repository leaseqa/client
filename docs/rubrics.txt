KAMBAZ PAZZA FINAL PROJECT

In this Web development course, your final project will culminate in an exciting 
challenge: creating Pazza, a clone of a popular Q&A platform of a similar name. 
Pazza will be integrated directly into the ongoing Kambaz project you've been 
developing throughout the semester. This project will test your skills in the 
MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js - providing you with 
practical experience in merging new functionalities into existing systems. You'll 
need to replicate Pazza's core features such as posting questions, answering, and 
categorizing discussions, all while ensuring seamless integration with your current 
codebase. This task will enhance your ability to manage larger codebases, practice 
full-stack development, and understand the complexities of feature integration in 
a live, evolving project.

Teams can have up to 5 members, but can be worked on individually.

DELIVERABLES:
- Submit link to landing page running on Netlify or equivalent
- Landing page must include:
  * Full names and sections of all team members
  * Link to GitHub repository (front end)
  * Link to GitHub repository (server)
